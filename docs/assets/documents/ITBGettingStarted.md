## 1 How to register

1. Go to <a href="https://test.itb.medcom.dk/" target="_blank">ITB Login</a>

2. Your organization needs to be registered in the ITB. Please ensure nobody has already registered your organization for this ITB community. 

3. If your organization has already been registered for this community, please contact your local admin to make them create a user for you. Login with your credentials and skip the rest of these steps.

4. Click on "Register in a public community"

8. You should also create the system that represents your software server/entity that is being tested in the ITB. Example: Let's say our organization is Microsoft, then we might have many systems such as Outlook, Word, PowerPoint etc. 

9. In the left hand navigation menu you can find "Conformance statements" which is where you will find the tests that you are to conform to.
