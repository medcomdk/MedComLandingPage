The purpose of this section is to give an introduction to MedCom's FHIR standards to stakeholders with no or limited knowledge about FHIR. On this page, you will find a brief introduction to the most frequently used terms and guidance to more information about FHIR and MedComs FHIR standards. 


## 1 FHIR Glossary
<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/" target="_blank">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&reg;&copy;)</a> is developed by the international organization Health Level 7 (HL7) and is an open-source standard developed to exchange healthcare-related information. FHIR defines several resources, often referred to as ‘building blocks’, each describing a delimited area within healthcare e.g., a Patient or an Encounter. These resources are generic and can therefore be used across the world. However, when using the resources in a specific context, such as communication between Danish healthcare parties, the resources need to be profiled to accommodate the use. The profiling could be to require the last name of a Patient. In some cases, it is necessary to extend the generic resources to fit the context e.g., to add a civil registration number (Danish: CPR-nummer) as a patient identifier.

When creating a MedCom FHIR standard, multiple profiles are assembled to include the information necessary to support the business requirements. Under the auspices of MedCom, these profiles will most often come from multiple Implementation Guides (IG). This decision is further addressed in  section [ Why are there Multiple Implementation Guides?](FAQ.md) that can be founded in the Frequen aked qestions page.  

The first wave of MedCom's modernisation only includes messages, which means that there must always be a sender and a receiver. A relevant exchange paradigm could be to upload data as services or as documents where multiple receivers can get access to data or documents. If another exchange exchange paradigm is to be used, it is possible to reuse the profiles from the Core IG. This is an example of FHIR's reusability across. The optimal exchange paradigm for a standard will be considered when modernizing the next wave of MedCom standards.

In the <a href="#Tab1">Table 1</a>  you will find the most common terms and associated descriptions and examples. These terms all describe a fundamental feature in FHIR, and they make the foundation to understand FHIR, and why they are presented initially.

> Note: the <a href="#Tab1">Table 1</a>  uses FHIR-paths to describe exactly which element is referred to e.g. Patient.name refers to the nameelement in the Patient resource.
