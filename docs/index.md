MedCom's modernisation project involves both rethinking business requirements and technical improvement. The modernisation is done in collaboration with MedCom's central partners. 

On our website <a href="https://www.medcom.dk/standarder/modernisering-af-medcom-standarder/" target="_blank">medcom.dk </a>, the political and strategical aspects of the modernisation are described. These aspects involve the initial wave of modernisation including HospitalNotification (Danish: Advis om sygehusophold), CareCommunication (Danish: Korrespondancemeddelelse), and Acknowledgement (Danish: Kvittering) standards. Furthermore, you can finde descriptions of the gradual phase-out of the existing  standards (EDIFACT and OIOXML), the implementation plan for the initial wave and descriptions of the upcoming waves of modernisation.

The purpose of this site is to describe both the business and technical implementation of the requirements for each standard. The aim of this page is to guide you to find more information about each standard. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 1 MedCom's FHIR standards
The business requirements describe the context in which a standard should be used, and they are presented on a webpage for each standard.
For a MedCom FHIR standard, the technical implementation is presented in an Implementation Guide (IG). An IG includes several rules, extensions, profiles and more. Each profile describes a delimited area within healthcare e.g., a patient, an organisation, or an encounter.
Some of the profiles are often used across standards. An example is the patient profile which includes the most central information about a patient or citizen, such as the civil registration number (Danish: CPR-nummer) or name. These types of profiles are called core profiles (Danish: kerneprofiler) and are gathered in the Core IG. Additionally, some profiles are often used when defining a message. These profiles are called messaging profiles (Danish: meddelelsesprofiler) and are gathered in the Messaging IG. 
Some profiles are specific for a standard, which is why these are gathered in the respective IG. 
Lastly, the terminology codes (Danish: terminologi), including all CodeSystems, ValueSet, and ConceptMaps are gathered in the Terminology IG.
Currently, there are three FHIR standards: HospitalNotification, CareCommunication, and Acknowledgement, which are all composed of profiles from the Core and Messaging IG as well as the IG for the specific standard, and codes from the Terminology IG. 

Due to the above mentioned, the <a href="#Tab1"> Table 1</a> is divided into three parts: 
1. MedCom's FHIR standards describes the MedCom FHIR standards and their business requirements.  
2. Terminology explanation describes the terminology used in the MedCom FHIR standards.
3. Generic profiles describes the profiles used across MedCom FHIR standards. 

<br>
Over time, the modernised FHIR standards will replace the existing MedCom standards. HospitalNotification replaces

## 2 Implementing a MedCom FHIR standard
When implementing a MedCom FHIR standard, it is fundamental to understand in which context the standard should be used to ensure that the implementation fulfils the business requirements. Therefore, it is important to understand the standard documentation for the given standard. 
Furthermore, it is essential to understand the messaging framework and the possibilities of the VANS Network, as the FHIR standards define the process for how information is packaged and sent from one part to another thtough the VANS Network.
The messaging framework and the VANS Network are described as governance, previously known as the “Syntax and Communication Rules". <br>
<a href="https://medcomdk.github.io/MedCom-FHIR-Communication/#network-layer" target="_blank"> Click here to get more information about governance.</a>  
<br>

### 2.1 Standard documentation
The purpose of the standard documentation is to describe the context in which a standard should be used and which requirements the standard should fulfil. Standard documentation is only provided for the Medcom's FHIR standards and thus not for the generic Core or Messaging Profiles.The content of the standard documentation can vary between the standards. 

<!-- An implementation guide, use cases, clinical guidelines for application and testprotocols will be available for all standards -->

<!-- .Furthermore, some additional documents might be available to support implementation, such as a mapping document.  -->
The Standard documentation can can consists of: 
* **Implementation Guide**: the technical specifications of the standard.
* **Clinical guidelines for appliccation**: the clinical consideration behind the modernisation.
* **Use cases**: the intended use of the standard.
* **Testprotocol**: used during test and certification to document that the vendor implementation fulfils the standard. 
* **Mapping document**: the mapping from the previous OIOXML standard to FHIR.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 2.2 Governance for MedCom HL7 FHIR Messaging
The governance is important to understand before implementing a MedCom FHIR standard, as it describes the Danish profiling of the FHIR messaging framework and the network layer, which is the VANS network at present. Since the existing VANS network is used to deliver messages, messages must be sent in a VANSenvelope unless otherwise specified. A receipt may be sent to a VANSenvelope or another receipt envelope, e.g. "Fælleskommunal Beskedfordeler" envelope. <br>
<a href="https://medcomdk.github.io/MedCom-FHIR-Communication/#network-layer" target="_blank"> Click here to get more information about governance.</a>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 3 Test and certification
Before using the implemented standard in a production environment to exchange patient data, it must be tested and certified by MedCom to ensure it fulfils the requirements. In addition to the usual <a href="https://www.medcom.dk/standarder/testcenter" target="_blank">MedCom test setup</a> with a self test and live test, <a href="https://touchstone.aegis.net/touchstone/" target="_blank">TouchStone</a> is used as a tool to validate FHIR messages sent in different use cases.

TouchStone describes an infrastructure that allows for automated tests against HL7 FHIR. For each FHIR standard MedCom will develope testscripts,that will be available on Touchstone. Thease test scripts can be used both during implementation and as a part of the test and certification. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 4 Change management and versioning  

### 4.1 Versioning of FHIR standard
MedComs FHIR standards follow the <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">semantic versioning, version 2.0</a>, which is adjusted to the workflow in MedCom. Each document, such as the clinical guidelines, use cases or other documentation, will have a version and a release note, to keep track of the changes in the document. The IG will have one version that covers all the artefacts.

Semantic versioning includes three numbers,which are separated by a dot, e.g. 2.1.4. The numbers are called <i>major.minor.patch</i>,which represent different degrees of changes: 
* MAJOR version changes when you make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version changed when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
* PATCH version changed when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

 The major and minor versions are  recorded  in  <a href="https://sundhedsdatastyrelsen.dk/da/rammer-og-retningslinjer/om-referencearkitektur-og-standarder/udvalg" target="_blank">Det Rådgivende Udvalg for Standarder og Arkitekturer (RUSA)</a>.
RUSA is a Danish advisory committee for standards and architecture. RUSA is working to ensure coherence and interoperability in digital solutions in the healthcare field. 
If a document or an IG has an extra number eg. 2.1.4-a.1 it is a prerelease and therefore not ready for implementation. In this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 4.1 you can read more about the use of semantic versioning in MedCom and what it means for changes in the FHIR standards. 
<a href="https://svn.medcom.dk/svn/qms/Offentlig/SOPer/" target="_blank"> Click here to read SOP-4.1.</a> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 4.2 Change requests and improvements
Stakeholders and vendors are alway welcome to submit requests for changes or improvements to the IG or other documentation. 
* If the request concerns the IG, it is possible to: 
  1. submit an issue to the relevant <a href="https://github.com/medcomdk ">MedCom GitHub repository</a>
  2. write an email to <a href="mailto:fhir@medcom.dk">fhir@medcom.dk</a> describing the request
* If the request concerns other documentation, please write an email to <a href="mailto:fhir@medcom.dk">fhir@medcom.dk</a>. 
<br>
Based on an analysis of the severity of the request, MedCom decides if the changes should be implemented and thus change the version of the artefact or IG to reflect the changes.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
